# Ebis Obrazovanie
A custom frontend for https://dnevnik.egov66.ru written in Rust. I had to make it because their website is shit.
Mostly finished, I have all the features I need, if you want you can make it into something actually useful.

## Building
Simple `cargo build`, nothing fancy. Also tested with `cross`.

## Usage
It's mostly intuitive. except for flags:
  - `-l` gosuslugi login
  - `-p` gosuslugi password
  - `-y` year to look up

## Contributing
Just go nuts, will appreciate any contribution whatsoever. No one cares anyway.
